# RALLY

**Executive Summary**

The Rally app facilitates frictionless social gatherings, easing the experience for casual event organizers and participants. Our aim is for fewer plans to fizzle and more fun times to be had by bringing together key event planning tools for an elegant, effortless user experience. Rather than allowing the banter of the group message to be strong-armed by a litany of event details or creating a duplicate chat youâ€™ll only use once, Rally offers event-based messaging amidst an ecosystem complete with a host of relevant event information and features. Plan a team bowling event and a weekly coffee meet-up with a few friends; poll the group to determine the best date for the function and share photos for the recap the next morning; never forget the name of the restaurant or what time to be there with easy calendar export. Rally does not intend to replace the group chat, your notes app, or a photo album. Instead, Rally is an iOS app that offers a complementary digital experience that declutters these other tools.
